Decided on making a subnet calculator + started setting it up:
- Set up a github repo.
- Made a new dotnet mvc application.
- Started adding different pages to the application to get the "UI setup".

- Transferred all of my code from the github repo to the gitlab repo.
- Debating whether I do a whole CI/CD process for deployment or just deploy it manually when I am finished.
- Made the changelog.
